+ Project summary: In this project, we trained a collection of models utilizing IMAGENET to predict image labels from a large dataset of noisy labels and a small set of cleaned labels using methods outlined in [[Inoue, et al (2017)]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017_workshops/papers/w32/Inoue_Multi-Label_Fashion_Image_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf). Our final model achieved ~52% test accuracy on the clean labels.
	
**Contribution statement**: Chengming coded and trained both model 1 and model 2 along with the image classifier for cleaning the labels. Kartik coded and trained a collection of models for model 1, evaluating & identifying the best one. Both Kartik and Chengming assisted with the overall project structure and flow for the team. Zeya created the slides and presented. Gabe coded and trained a model for model 1, and managed and organized the repo.
