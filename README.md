+ Project summary: In this project, we trained a collection of models utilizing IMAGENET to predict image labels from a large dataset of noisy labels and a small set of cleaned labels using methods outlined in [Inoue, et al (2017)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017_workshops/papers/w32/Inoue_Multi-Label_Fashion_Image_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf). Our final model achieved ~52% test accuracy on the clean labels.
